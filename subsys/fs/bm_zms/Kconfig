config BM_ZMS_LOOKUP_CACHE
	bool "BM_ZMS lookup cache"
	help
	  Enable BM_ZMS cache to reduce the BM_ZMS data lookup time.
	  Each cache entry holds an address of the most recent allocation
	  table entry (ATE) for all BM_ZMS IDs that fall into that cache position.

	help
	  Number of entries in the BM_ZMS lookup cache.
	  Every additional entry in cache will use 8 bytes of RAM.

config BM_ZMS_CUSTOMIZE_BLOCK_SIZE
	bool "Customize the size of the buffer used internally for reads and writes"
	help
	  BM_ZMS uses an internal buffer to read/write and compare stored data.
	  Increasing the size of this buffer should be done carefully in order to not
	  overflow the stack.
	  Increasing it makes BM_ZMS able to work with storage devices
	  that have a larger `write-block-size` (which decreases the performance of BM_ZMS).

config BM_ZMS_CUSTOM_BLOCK_SIZE
	int "BM_ZMS internal buffer size"
	depends on BM_ZMS_CUSTOMIZE_BLOCK_SIZE
	default 32
	help
	  Changes the internal buffer size of BM_ZMS.

config BM_ZMS_OP_QUEUE_SIZE
	int "BM_ZMS operations queue size"
	default 16
	help
	  defines the maximum number of operations that can be queued in BM_ZMS
