config MCUMGR_GRP_OS_RESET_HOOK
	bool "Reset hook"
	depends on REBOOT
	depends on MCUMGR_MGMT_NOTIFICATION_HOOKS
	help
	  Allows applications to control and get notifications of when a reset
	  command has been issued via an MCUmgr command. With this option
	  disabled, modules will reboot when the command is received without
	  notification, when this is enabled and a handler is registered, the
	  application will be notified that a reset command has been received
	  and will allow the application to perform any required operations
	  before accepting or declining the reset request.

config MCUMGR_GRP_OS_RESET_BOOT_MODE
	bool "Boot mode"
	depends on RETENTION_BOOT_MODE
	help
	  Allows applications to set the boot mode using the retention boot mode module which
	  allows for booting other images e.g. as part of a bootloader. This is done with an
	  optional field in the reset command which specifies the value of the boot mode.

	  Can be used similarly to the unix/linux uname command for retrieving system information

	int "Maximum response size for info command"

	help
	  The maximum size of the response to the info command, will use a stack buffer of this
	  size to store the data in. If the output response is too big then the output will not be
	  present in the response, which will just contain the result code (rc) of memory error.

config MCUMGR_GRP_OS_INFO_CUSTOM_HOOKS
	bool "Custom info hooks"
	depends on MCUMGR_MGMT_NOTIFICATION_HOOKS
	help
	  Supports adding custom command/character processing to the info command by using
	  registered callbacks. Data can be appended to the struct provided in the callback.

config MCUMGR_GRP_OS_INFO_BUILD_DATE_TIME
	bool "Show build date and time"
	help
	  Will allow returning the build date and time of the firmware by using the info with
	  format option 'b' (will also be returned with all responses by using 'a').

	  Note: This will invalidate reproducible builds of the firmware as it will embed the
	  build date/time in the output firmware image.
