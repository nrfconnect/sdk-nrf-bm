config MCUMGR_GRP_IMG_UPDATABLE_IMAGE_NUMBER
	int "Number of supported images"
	default UPDATEABLE_IMAGE_NUMBER
	range 1 3
	help
	  Sets how many application images are supported (pairs of secondary and primary slots).
	  Setting this to 2 requires MCUMGR_TRANSPORT_NETBUF_SIZE to be at least 512b.
	  NOTE: The UPDATEABLE_IMAGE_NUMBER of MCUBOOT configuration, even for Zephyr build,
	  needs to be set to the same value; this is due to the fact that the MCUmgr uses
	  boot_util and the UPDATEABLE_IMAGE_NUMBER controls number of images supported
	  by that library.

	bool "Verbose error responses when uploading application image"

	  Add additional "rsn" key to SMP responses, where provided, explaining
	  non-0 "rc" codes.

config MCUMGR_GRP_IMG_ALLOW_CONFIRM_NON_ACTIVE_IMAGE_SECONDARY
	bool "Allow to confirm secondary slot of non-active image"
	default y
	help
	  Allows to confirm secondary (non-active) slot of non-active image.
	  Normally it should not be allowed to confirm any slots of non-active
	  image, via MCUmgr commands, to prevent confirming something that is
	  broken and may not boot in other slot; instead application should
	  have means to test and confirm the image.

	  By default, the image version comparison relies only on version major,

	bool "Status hooks"
	depends on MCUMGR_MGMT_NOTIFICATION_HOOKS
	help
	  This will enable DFU status hooks which can be checked by the application to monitor DFU

	  or prevent it, CONFIG_MCUMGR_GRP_IMG_UPLOAD_CHECK_HOOK must be used.

	prompt "Image size check overhead"
	default MCUMGR_GRP_IMG_TOO_LARGE_DISABLED
	help
	  MCUboot images should be limited to the maximum size that the bootloader can swap, in
	  order to know this size, additional information is needed from the MCUboot
	  configuration, otherwise an image can be uploaded that is too large for the bootloader
	  to swap, this selects which method to use.

	  Note: setting this to a non-disabled option will prevent uploading of padded and
	  confirmed images, if support for that is required then this feature should be left as
	  disabled.

config MCUMGR_GRP_IMG_TOO_LARGE_DISABLED
	bool "Disabled"

	  Will not take MCUboot configuration into account when checking for maximum file size.

	  This is used for defining CBOR map holding group data.

config MCUMGR_GRP_IMG_SLOT_INFO
	bool "Slot info"
