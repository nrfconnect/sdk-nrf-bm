s115_9.0.0-4.prototype
======================

This version is a major release, providing support for nRF54L series devices.

Notes:

- This release has changed the API. This requires changes to applications.
- The release notes list changes since s115_9.0.0-3.prototype.


SoftDevice properties
---------------------

* This SoftDevice variant is compatible with
  nRF54L05, nRF54L10, and nRF54L15.

* The SoftDevice memory requirements for this version are as follows:

  * NVM: **107.0 kB** (0x1AC00 bytes).

  * RAM: **4.9 kB** (0x1380 bytes).
    This is the minimum required memory. The actual requirements depend on the
    configuration chosen at ``sd_ble_enable()`` time.

  * Call stack: The SoftDevice uses a call stack combined with the application.
    The worst-case stack usage for the SoftDevice is
    **1.8 kB**
    (0x700 bytes). Application writers should ensure
    that enough stack space is reserved to cover the worst-case SoftDevice call
    stack usage combined with the worst-case application call stack usage.

* SoftDevice base address:

  * nRF54L05: 0x062000 (``s115_nrf54l05_9.0.0-4.prototype_softdevice.hex``).

  * nRF54L10: 0x0E2000 (``s115_nrf54l10_9.0.0-4.prototype_softdevice.hex``).

  * nRF54L15: 0x162000 (``s115_nrf54l15_9.0.0-4.prototype_softdevice.hex``).

* The Firmware ID of this SoftDevice is 0x300B.

New Features
-------------

Changes
-------

* SoftDevice

  * The function ``sd_flash_write`` now uses buffered writes to RRAM, with WRITEBUFSIZE=1.
    This reduces RRAM wear and improves performance (DRGN-24675).

  * A new field ``hfint_ctiv`` has been added to ``nrf_clock_lf_cfg_t`` to control how often HFINT is calibrated (DRGN-26506).

  * A new field ``hfclk_latency`` has been added to ``nrf_clock_lf_cfg_t`` to inform the SoftDevice
    about the ramp-up time of the high-frequency crystal oscillator (DRGN-26554).

* GAP

  * The SoftDevice no longer enforces the spec-required 1 second interval between channel map updates (``ble_gap_opt_ch_map_t``) (DRGN-26253).

  * The SoftDevice no longer allows an all-zeroes Identity Resolving Key (IRK) in the device identity list
    when in network privacy mode (``BLE_GAP_PRIVACY_MODE_NETWORK_PRIVACY``).
    ``sd_ble_gap_privacy_set`` and ``sd_ble_gap_device_identities_set`` now return ``BLE_ERROR_GAP_ZERO_IRK_NOT_ALLOWED`` in this case.

  * The SoftDevice now uses an application-provided passkey (``BLE_GAP_OPT_PASSKEY``) for only one pairing attempt.
    Using a static or non-random passkey is insecure and not allowed by the Bluetooth Core Specification (DRGN-26638).

  * The API for Data Signing has been removed. This was never supported by the SoftDevice (DRGN-26752).

  * The API for BR/EDR Link Key has been removed. This was never supported by the SoftDevice (DRGN-26752).


Limitations
-----------

* SoftDevice

  * If Radio Notifications are enabled, flash write and flash erase operations
    initiated through the SoftDevice API will be notified to the application as
    Radio Events (DRGN-5197).

  * Synthesized low frequency clock source is not tested or intended for use
    with the Bluetooth LE stack.

  * Applications must not modify the SEVONPEND flag in the SCR register when
    running in priority levels higher than 6 (priority level numerical values
    lower than 6) as this can lead to undefined behavior.

  * The SoftDevice may generate several events when connected, based on peer
    actions, meaning without previous action from the application. The
    ``BLE_GAP_EVT_PHY_UPDATE_REQUEST`` event, for instance, is generated when a
    connected peer sends a Phy Update Request, even when an application does not
    include logic to change PHY. There are several such events that may require
    action from an application if they are received. For more information, see the
    ``sd_ble_enable()`` API in SoftDevice.

  * Configuring multiple connection configurations (see ``ble_conn_cfg_t::conn_cfg_tag``) is not supported (DRGN-23839).

* GATT

  * To conform to the Bluetooth Core Specification, there shall be no
    secondary service that is not referenced somehow by a primary service. The
    SoftDevice does not enforce this (DRGN-906).

Known Issues
------------

* SoftDevice

* LL

  * If the application adds an all zeroes IRK with the
    ``sd_ble_gap_device_identities_set()``, it will be treated as a valid entry
    in the device identity list. An all zeroes IRK is invalid and must not be
    added (DRGN-9083).
