[body-match-regex]
# Regex that the commit-msg body should contain. It points to the issue that prompted
# the commit. The format of this inclusion should be "Ref: <project>-xxxx". This is
# used to track changes to the codebase and have a reference to the origins of the
# proposed changes. A workaround can be used by specifying "Ref: NONE".
