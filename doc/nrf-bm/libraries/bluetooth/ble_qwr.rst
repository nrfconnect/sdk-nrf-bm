The Bluetooth LE Queued Writes (QWR) library provides an implementation of the Queued Writes feature, allowing data to be written over multiple commands.
This is particularly useful for writing attribute values that exceed the length of a single packet.

Overview
********

Writing to a GATT characteristic can be done in a single write command or in a series of commands.
Splitting the write operation into several commands allows for writing attribute values that are longer than a single packet.
Such a series of write commands, called a Queued Write operation, involves multiple Prepare Write commands followed by a single Execute Write command.

The Queued Writes library provides an implementation of Queued Writes using the Generic Attribute Profile (GATT) Server interface of the SoftDevice.
Add this module to your GATT server implementation to enable support for Queued Writes for some or all of the characteristics.
A GATT client can then write to these characteristics using a series of commands.

Configuration
*************

The library is enabled and configured using the Kconfig system.
Set the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BLE_QWR` Kconfig option to enable the library.

The :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BLE_QWR_MAX_ATTR` Kconfig option sets the maximum number of attributes that can be handled by the Queued Writes library.
Setting this to zero disables all Queued Write operations.

Initialization
==============

To initialize an instance of the module, call the :c:func:`ble_qwr_init` function.

You must provide a configuration structure that includes an event handler and a data buffer.
Without a buffer, the library cannot store received data and will reject Queued Writes requests.

After initialization, call the :c:func:`ble_qwr_attr_register` function repeatedly to register each characteristic attribute for which you want to enable Queued Writes.
Attributes are identified by their handles.

Usage
*****

The library uses a callback function to handle write authorization.
When it receives an Execute Write request, it calls the callback function with a :c:enum:`BLE_QWR_EVT_AUTH_REQUEST` event to determine whether the request should be accepted:

* To authorize the request, the callback function must return :c:macro:`BLE_GATT_STATUS_SUCCESS`.
  The module then writes all received data and notifies the GATT server that the data is ready to use by calling the callback function again, this time with a :c:enum:`BLE_QWR_EVT_EXECUTE_WRITE` event.
* To reject the request (for example, because the received data is not valid or the application is busy), the callback function must return a BLE GATT status code other than :c:macro:`BLE_GATT_STATUS_SUCCESS`.
  The module then deletes the received data.

Dependencies
************

This library uses the following |BMshort| libraries:

* SoftDevice - :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_SOFTDEVICE`
* SoftDevice handler - :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_NRF_SDH`
