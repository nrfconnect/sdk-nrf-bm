   .. group-tab:: Pre-packaged SDK & Toolchain

      Complete the following steps to get the |BMshort| code using the |nRFVSC|.

      1. If this is your first time installing the SDK, click :guilabel:`Install SDK` in the extension's :guilabel:`Welcome View`.

         If you have installed an SDK or a Toolchain before, click on :guilabel:`Manage SDKs` in the extension's :guilabel:`Welcome View`.
         Then, select :guilabel:`Install SDK` from the quick pick menu that appears.

      #. In the next page you will be prompted to **Select SDK type**, click :guilabel:`nRF Connect SDK Bare Metal`.

      #. In the next page you will be prompted to **Select an SDK version (or enter the branch, tag or commit SHA) to install...**, click :guilabel:`v0.8.0` marked on the right by the label :guilabel:`Pre-packaged SDKs & Toolchains`.

      #. In the next page you will be prompted to select a destination for the SDK. The default suggestion is recommended. Then press **Enter**.
         This will proceed by installing |BMshort| and the respective Toolchain it requires.

         1. Install the toolchain

            The |BMshort| toolchain includes tools and modules required to build the samples and applications on top of it.

            Use nRF Connect for VS Code to install the toolchain:

            .. note::
               These instructions are tested using |nRFVSC| version 2025.5.92.
               Newer versions of the extension might feature changes to the user interface.
               It is recommended to use the latest version of the extension.

            1. Open the nRF Connect extension in |VSC| by clicking its icon in the :guilabel:`Activity Bar`.
            #. If this is your first time installing the toolchain, click :guilabel:`Install Toolchain` in the extension's :guilabel:`Welcome View`.

               If you have installed a toolchain before, click on :guilabel:`Manage toolchains` in the extension's :guilabel:`Welcome View`.
               Then, select :guilabel:`Install Toolchain` from the quick pick menu that appears.

            #. The list of available stable toolchain versions appears in the |VSC|'s quick pick.
            #. Select the toolchain version to install.
               For this release of |BMshort|, use version |ncs_release| of the toolchain.

            .. note::
               Every |BMshort| release uses the toolchain of the |NCS| version that it is based on.

            The toolchain installation starts in the background, as can be seen in the notification that appears.
            If this is your first installation of the toolchain, wait for it to finish before moving to the next step of this procedure (getting the code).

            When you install the toolchain for the first time, the installed version is automatically selected for your project.

         #. Install the SDK

            Complete the following steps to get the |BMshort| code using the |nRFVSC|.

            1. In the extension's :guilabel:`Welcome View`, click :guilabel:`Manage SDKs`. A popup window will appear.

            #. Click :guilabel:`Install SDK`.

            #. In the next page you will be prompted to **Select SDK type**, click :guilabel:`nRF Connect SDK Bare Metal`.

            #. In the next page you will be prompted to **Select an SDK version (or enter the branch, tag or commit SHA) to install...**, click :guilabel:`v0.8.0` marked on the right by the label :guilabel:`GitHub`.

            #. In the next page you will be prompted to select a destination for the SDK. The default suggestion is recommended. Then press **Enter**.
               This will proceed by installing |BMshort|.

You can now proceed to test the :ref:`samples` included in this version of |BMshort|.

The samples can be found in the :file:`nrf-bm/samples` folder, and are divided into subfolders:

* :file:`bluetooth` for the samples showcasing Bluetooth® LE functionalities using the SoftDevice.
  See :ref:`ble_samples`.
* :file:`peripherals` for the samples showcasing various peripheral functionalities that do not require the SoftDevice.
  See :ref:`peripheral_samples`.
