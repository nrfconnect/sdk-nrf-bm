Migration notes - nRF5 SDK to nRF Connect SDK Bare Metal
########################################################

This document outlines the high-level differences between nRF5 SDK and the |BMlong|.

It is meant to provide support when migrating an application built on nRF5 SDK to |BMshort|.

.. note::

   This document is in development and being constantly updated.

Project files
*************

In nRF5, project files are tightly coupled with the SDK directory structure.

Typically, projects are placed inside the :file:`examples` folder within the SDK and include header files, source files, and pre-built libraries in defined locations within the SDK.
These projects rely on embedded IDEs project files, such Keil µVision or IAR, or GNU Makefiles, which all have very limited dependency management.
Developers have to manually handle their project dependencies, adding libraries and their relative headers to their project by navigating the IDE’s menu, which can be tedious for large projects.

In an nRF5 SDK project, project configuration is achieved through the :file:`sdk_config.h` file, which sets the configuration options present in the nRF5 SDK that are applicable to a given project.
When new dependencies are manually added to the project, their relative configuration entries in the project’s initial :file:`sdk_config.h` file are missing, and must also be added manually.

In |BMshort|, projects can be organized more freely and managed more easily thanks to the new build system based on CMake and west.
An application can reside in any folder, and includes a :file:`CMakeLists.txt` build system configuration file (for CMake) and a :file:`prj.conf` project configuration file (for Kconfig, which is a tool that is part of the build system).

The purpose of the :file:`CMakeLists.txt` file is to define the structure of the project, such as source files, libraries, dependencies, and build targets.
Specifically, this file is used to:

* Define the name of your project.
* Add source files:

  * Specify the source files for your application that need to be compiled.
    This includes main files, libraries, or any additional ``.c`` or ``.cpp`` code.

    .. code-block:: cmake

       target_sources(app PRIVATE src/main.c src/other_module.c)

* Include headers:

  * Add directories for custom include paths to ensure header files are correctly found.

    .. code-block:: cmake

       target_include_directories(app PRIVATE include)

* Link libraries:

  * Add external or custom libraries required for your project (such as math, custom vendor libraries).

    .. code-block:: cmake

       target_link_libraries(app PRIVATE libfoo)

* External modules and definitions:

  * If your project relies on external modules or additional functionality, include them.

    .. code-block:: cmake

       add_subdirectory("path_to_directory")

Dependencies are added to the project configuration and incorporated into the build process automatically (you do not have to manually add files from specific locations), with the aid of a tool called Kconfig, in conjunction with CMake.
That is done using the :file:`prj.conf` file that replaces the :file:`sdk_config.h` file from the nRF5 SDK.
The entries in the :file:`prj.conf` file are referred to as **Kconfig options**.

Unlike the :file:`sdk_config.h` file that lists all the configuration options relevant for an application, even those whose values are unchanged from defaults, the :file:`prj.conf` file only contains entries whose values must be manually set or to override the default.

The configuration options whose values are left as default are not present in that file, although when a project is built, a file containing all configuration options pertaining to the application (called :file:`autoconf.h`) is created in the background.
The build system and the |nRFVSC| extension both provide a way to conveniently browse and search all available project options and inspect their dependencies and read their help text (menuconfig/extension).

There is no distinction or taxonomy between Kconfig options that are applicable to regular |NCS| only and those that are only applicable to |BMlong|.
Kconfig options that are applicable to the current application are shown and are selectable, while others are not.

There is no consistent mapping of the :file:`sdk_config.h` entries to Kconfig options.
Some libraries that were ported from nRF5 have similar Kconfig options as the :file:`sdk_config.h` entries they had in nRF5, but it is not a consistent rule.

In nRF5, the same application/sample had a project file for each supported board and IDE/compiler.
In |BMshort|, there is a single project file (consisting of :file:`CMakeLists.txt` and :file:`prj.conf`) that can be built for different boards with a different command-line instruction or by selecting a different board target in the VS Code extension.
If necessary, Kconfig options can be specified in a different :file:`.conf` file that is then automatically appended to the default :file:`prj.conf` file, thus realizing a dedicated configuration for a specific board.
Kconfig options appended in this way are referred to as **Kconfig fragments**.

Memory partitioning
===================

In nRF5, memory partitioning was done using linker scripts.
In |BMshort|, there are a few ready-made partitioning schemes that can be selected by compiling for specific board targets that cover the most common use cases.
Partitioning can be tweaked by making simple changes to textual **Devicetree** files which define the layout of the memory.
These can be edited in the board files, or applied to existing boards as **overlays**.

Bluetooth LE libraries
**********************

Whereas nRF5 supported different short range protocols such as Gazell, ESB, and Ant, those are not supported by |BMshort|.
In general, |BMshort| support focuses on Bluetooth Low Energy.

Bluetooth LE features that are natively offered by the SoftDevice are mostly unchanged from the nRF5, and the SoftDevice documentation highlights any differences.
As for the collection of Bluetooth LE libraries that were available in the nRF5, |BMshort| offers a limited subset, where each service may have slightly different API and functionality compared to their respective nRF5 implementation.

The Bluetooth LE services currently offered in |BMshort| are the following:

* Peripheral services:

  * Heart Rate Monitor (peripheral)
  * Nordic UART (NUS) (peripheral)
  * Nordic LED Button (LBS) (peripheral)
  * Continuous Glucose Monitor (peripheral)
  * Battery (peripheral)

* MCUMgr service (DFU service)
* Bond Management
* Device Information

Utility libraries for Bluetooth LE are available in |BMshort|, though their collection may not be as complete, and their functionality and API may be slightly different than their respective nRF5 implementation.

SoftDevice integration
**********************

The SoftDevice, serving as a Bluetooth Low Energy protocol stack, maintains a consistent API from the nRF5 SDK to the |BMshort| environment.
For instance, the API functionalities in SoftDevice S115 are comparable to those in S113.

However, notable changes have occurred in how the SoftDevice is integrated within the system.

Memory placement and boot process
=================================

In the nRF5 SDK, the SoftDevice was bundled with the Master Boot Record (MBR) and positioned at the beginning of the non-volatile memory (NVM).
This setup was crucial for the device's booting process and interrupt handling.
In contrast, in the |BMshort| environment, the SoftDevice is treated more like a peripheral driver that is initialized by the application.
The MBR is no longer used, and the SoftDevice is now located at the top of the memory.

Interrupt Handling
==================

The responsibility for interrupt handling has shifted in |BMshort| - the application must now manage interrupts and forward them to the SoftDevice as needed.

It is important to note that while the API remains compatible, the SoftDevices themselves are not binary-compatible between the two environments.
SoftDevices from the nRF5 SDK cannot be reused in |BMshort|, and similarly, the S115 SoftDevice is not compatible with the nRF5 SDK.

Other libraries
***************

Regarding other utility libraries unrelated to Bluetooth LE, like ``app_timer``, a limited selection is available, often with a different name and slightly different API than their nRF5 variant.

Although sometimes a pattern can emerge on how to port from one to the other, no general rule is available and this must be done on a case-by-case basis.
This is due to several factors, including:

* Large number of libraries, with a mix of naming schemes such as ``ble_`` , ``nrf_``, no prefix.
* Large set of API, developed over the course of several years with little overall consistency with regards to error spaces, asynchronous events.
* Different project configuration mechanism, inherently affecting how libraries are configured.
* Different coding standard in the |NCS| (for example, limited use of ``typedef``).

DFU
***

The Device Firmware Update (DFU) mechanism has evolved from the nRF5 SDK to |BMshort|.
While some core functionalities remain, they have been implemented differently.

Memory partitioning comparison
==============================

The following diagram shows the mapping of memory partitions in an nRF5 solution versus the |BMshort| solution.

.. figure:: /images/nrf5_bm_memory_part.svg
   :alt: nRF5 SDK memory partitioning for DFU

For more details about the two solutions, see `nRF5 SDK DFU memory layout`_ and |BMshort| :ref:`dfu_memory_partitioning`.

Like the nRF5 SDK, the Bare Metal also supports single-bank DFU updates, as well as updates to the SoftDevice and the firmware loader.

Bootloader Changes
==================

In the nRF5 SDK, the boot process involved two main components: the Master Boot Record (MBR), delivered with the SoftDevice, and the nRF5 Bootloader.
The MBR served as a simple first-stage bootloader, responsible for jumping to either the application or the bootloader and supporting basic copy functionality for replacing the bootloader or the SoftDevice.

The nRF5 Bootloader was capable of downloading new firmware or combined SoftDevice and Bootloader images, which the MBR could then copy if needed.

In the |BMshort| solution, the bootloader has been replaced by the open-source MCUboot project, which serves as the first-stage (immutable) bootloader.
MCUboot, also used in the |NCS| and other open-source projects, focuses primarily on image validation.
It ensures that before an image is started, it has not been tampered with and is signed by the correct author.

Firmware loader changes
=======================

The firmware loader in |BMshort| is somewhat comparable to the nRF5 Bootloader in functionality.
However, their roles differ slightly.
While the nRF5 Bootloader managed both the download process and image validation, the firmware loader in |BMshort| is solely responsible for the download process.
Image validation is handled by MCUboot.

The process for updating the SoftDevice and the firmware loader is similar in both the old and new solutions, requiring the reuse of application space as storage for the update.
The key difference lies in how the update is moved from temporary storage to the correct partition.
In the nRF5 SDK, this copy functionality was managed by the MBR, whereas in |BMshort|, it is handled by an installer image that is downloaded along with the new update.

Protocol Changes
================

The protocol used to upload new images to the device has also changed.
The previous nRF5 SDK solution utilized a Nordic proprietary DFU protocol, while |BMshort| adopts the `MCUmgr SMP protocol`_, which is also used in the |NCS|.

Tool Compatibility
==================

The desktop and mobile tools available for the |NCS| are also compatible with the |BMshort| solution.
