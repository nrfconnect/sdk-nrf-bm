Configuring and building the sample
===================================

Follow these steps to create your first build configuration for this sample:

1. Verify the configuration of this sample.

   You will need the following information:

   * The |NCS| version and toolchain version the current |BMshort| release is based on: v3.0.1
   * The board target onto which you want to program the firmware (**Requirements** section).

   This information will be used in the steps that follow.

   .. note::
      The following steps will use the **Hello SoftDevice** sample as reference.

#. In the `Applications View`_, click on :guilabel:`Add build configuration`.

      Add Build Configuration

#. This opens the **Add Build Configuration** page.

#. For your very first build configuration, double-check that the values in the |NCS| and toolchain menus match the expected versions.

#. Select the board target onto which you want to program the firmware.

   For your very first build configuration, select a compatible board target from the drop down menu.

#. Leave all the other options as default.

   For more details on how to configure builds, see `How to build an application`_ in |VSC| extension documentation.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Generate and Build` button.

   The |VSC| extension generates the configuration file and triggers the build process, which can take some time. You can monitor its progress in the notification that appears.

   When the process is complete, the `Actions View`_ appears. In this View, you can trigger the build process again, flash the built application, start a debug session, or generate a memory report.
   The build files appear in the build's `Details View`_, which is named after your application.
