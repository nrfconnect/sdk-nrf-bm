Allow list
==========

By default, the sample does not use allow-list advertising, which means that any nearby device can connect and bond with the device.
Bonded devices are stored in internal non-volatile memory (NVM) and are remembered across power cycles.

You can enable allow-list advertising by setting the :kconfig:option:`CONFIG_BLE_ADV_USE_ALLOW_LIST` Kconfig option to ``y`` in the base Kconfig fragment (:file:`prj.conf`).
When enabled, only previously bonded devices are allowed to reconnect, which allows faster reconnection and prevents unknown devices from connecting.

When allow-list advertising is enabled and you want to add a new bonded device, existing bonds must first be deleted.
This can be done through user interaction, as described in the user interface section.
