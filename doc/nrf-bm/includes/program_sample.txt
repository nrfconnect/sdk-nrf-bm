Programming the sample
======================

Follow these steps to program this sample:

1. Plug in your device to the serial terminal using a USB cable.
   Your device appears on the `Connected Devices View`_ list in |VSC|.
#. To flash the application you have built, select your build folder in the `Applications View`_.
   Then, click :guilabel:`Flash` in the `Actions View`_ after connecting the device to the terminal.

.. note::

  When programming a board for the first time using MCUboot board variants with KMU (default), make sure the KMU is programmed with the necessary keys.

  * Using the command line: Execute ``west flash --erase`` or ``west flash --recover``.
  * Using Visual Studio Code: In the Actions View, hover over the :guilabel:`Flash` option.
    Click :guilabel:`Erase and Flash to Board`, which appears to the right under :guilabel:`More actions`.
