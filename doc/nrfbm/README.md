# sdk-nrf-bm doc build
This is a temporary doc build script that will be replaced in the future.
It installs dependencies, copies the RST sources to _build/source, and runs Sphinx from there.

## Building the docs

Run the script in this folder:
   ```
   python gen_docs.py
   ```

Open _build/html/index.html to view the output.

Tested with Python 3.10.
