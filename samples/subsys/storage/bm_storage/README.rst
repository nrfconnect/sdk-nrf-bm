The Bare Metal Storage sample demonstrates how to configure and use storage instances with event callbacks.
Depending on the configuration selected, the sample uses either the SoftDevice storage backend or the RRAM storage backend.

Refer to the `Kconfig fragments`_ section for more information on configuration.

Requirements
************

The sample supports the following development kits:

Kconfig fragments
*****************

By default, the sample uses the SoftDevice storage backend.
To configure it for this sample, follow the steps outlined in :ref:`sample_intro_config_build`.

User interface
**************

LED 0:
  Lit when the device storage has been successfully initialized.

Building and running
********************

This sample can be found under :file:`samples/subsys/storage/bm_storage/` in the |BMshort| folder structure.

For details on how to create, configure, and program a sample, see :ref:`getting_started_with_the_samples`.

Testing
=======

You can test this sample by performing the following steps:

1. Compile and program the application.
#. Observe that the following output is printed:
