Overview
********

The sample initializes a PWM instance that blinks **LED 1** and **LED 3** on the device.

.. note::

  The PWM signal can be exposed only on GPIO pins that belong to the same domain as the target pin.
  For the nRF54L Series, there is only one domain which contains both PWM and GPIO: PWM20/21/22 and GPIO Port P1.
  Therefore, for these devices, only LEDs connected to P1 can work with PWM - for the nRF54L15 DK these are **LED 1** and **LED 3**.

Building and running
********************

This sample can be found under :file:`samples/peripherals/pwm/` in the |BMshort| folder structure.

Testing
=======

You can test this sample by performing the following steps:

1. Compile and program the application.
#. Observe that the ``PWM sample started`` message is printed.
#. Observe that **LED 1** and **LED 3** are blinking.
