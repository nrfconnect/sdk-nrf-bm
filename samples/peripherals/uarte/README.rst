Overview
********

The sample initializes the application UARTE instance, specified in the :file:`board-config.h` file in the board.
It then outputs a message on the UART before echoing the message entered by the user.

Building and running
********************

This sample can be found under :file:`samples/peripherals/uarte/` in the |BMshort| folder structure.

.. include:: /includes/create_sample.txt

.. include:: /includes/configure_and_build_sample.txt

.. include:: /includes/program_sample.txt

Testing
=======

You can test this sample by performing the following steps:

1. Compile and program the application.
#. Observe that the ``UARTE sample started`` message is printed in one terminal.
#. Observe that the ``Hello world! I will echo the lines you enter:`` message is printed in another terminal.
#. Enter a message in the terminal.
   Observe that you receive the same line in response when pressing Enter (sending ``\r`` or ``\n`` to the device).
