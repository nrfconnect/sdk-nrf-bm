The Storage sample demonstrates how to configure and use storage instances with event callbacks.
Depending on the configuration selected, the sample uses either the SoftDevice storage backend or the RRAM storage backend.

Refer to the `Kconfig fragments`_ section for more information on configuration.

Kconfig fragments
*****************

By default, the sample uses the SoftDevice storage backend.
To build the sample for the RRAM backend, you can use the :file:`storage-rram.conf` Kconfig fragment.
To configure it for this sample, follow the steps outlined in the `Configuring and building the sample`_ section.

Building and running
********************

This sample can be found under :file:`samples/peripherals/storage/` in the |BMshort| folder structure.
