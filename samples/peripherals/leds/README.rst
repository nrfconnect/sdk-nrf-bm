Overview
********

The sample initializes and blinks LED0 on the device.

Building and running
********************

This sample can be found under :file:`samples/peripherals/leds/` in the |BMshort| folder structure.

.. include:: /includes/create_sample.txt

Testing
=======

You can test this sample by performing the following steps:

1. Compile and program the application.
#. Observe that the ``LEDs sample started`` message is printed.
#. Observe that LED0 is blinking.
