Overview
********

The sample initializes and blinks LED0 on the device.

User interface
**************

LED 0:
  Lit when the device is initialized.

LED 2:
  Blinky LED.

Building and running
********************

This sample can be found under :file:`samples/peripherals/leds/` in the |BMshort| folder structure.

For details on how to create, configure, and program a sample, see :ref:`getting_started_with_the_samples`.

Testing
=======

You can test this sample by performing the following steps:

1. Compile and program the application.
#. Observe that the ``LEDs sample initialized`` message is printed.
#. Observe that LED0 is blinking.
