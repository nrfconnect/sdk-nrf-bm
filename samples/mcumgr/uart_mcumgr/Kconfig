config UART_MCUMGR_RX_BUF_SIZE
	int "Size of receive buffer for mcumgr fragments received over UART, in bytes"
	default 128
	help
	  Specifies the size of the mcumgr UART receive buffer, in bytes. This
	  value must be large enough to accommodate any line sent by an mcumgr
	  client.

config UART_MCUMGR_RX_BUF_COUNT
	int "Number of receive buffers for mcumgr fragments received over UART"
	default 8
	help
	  Specifies the number of the mcumgr UART receive buffers.  Receive
	  buffers hold received mcumgr fragments prior to reassembly.  This
	  setting's value must satisfy the following relation:
	  UART_MCUMGR_RX_BUF_COUNT * UART_MCUMGR_RX_BUF_SIZE >=
	  MCUMGR_TRANSPORT_UART_MTU

config UARTE_HWFC
	bool "UARTE HWFC"
	help
	  Enable hardware flow control on the UARTE peripheral used by the application.

config UARTE_PARITY
	bool "UARTE parity"
	help
	  Enable parity on the UARTE peripheral used by the application.

config UARTE_IRQ_PRIO
	int "UARTE IRQ priority"
	default 3
