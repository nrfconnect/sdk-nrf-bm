Overview
********

The sample uses the buttons on a development kit to simulate the movement of a mouse.
The four buttons simulate movement to the left, up, right, and down, respectively.
Mouse clicks are not simulated.

This sample exposes the HID GATT Service.
It uses a report map for a generic mouse.
