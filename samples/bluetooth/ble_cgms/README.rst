Overview
********

The Continuous Glucose Monitoring Service (CGMS) is a service that exposes glucose and other data from a personal Continuous Glucose Monitoring sensor.

Building and running
********************

This sample can be found under :file:`samples/bluetooth/ble_cgms/` in the |BMshort| folder structure.

Testing
=======

1. Compile and program the application.
#. Connect the device to the computer.
#. Connect to the kit with a terminal emulator (for example, the `Serial Terminal app`_).
   Note that the kit has two UARTs, where only one will output the log.
#. Reset the kit.
#. In the Serial Terminal, observe that the ``Continuous Glucose Monitoring sample started.`` message is printed.
#. Observe that the device is advertising under the default name ``nRF_BM_CGMS``.
   You can configure this name using the ``CONFIG_BLE_ADV_NAME`` Kconfig option.
   For information on how to do this, see `Configuring Kconfig`_.
#. Connect to your device using the `nRF Toolbox`_ mobile application with the :guilabel:`Continuous Glucose` service.
#. Observe that the text ``Connected`` and ``CGMS Start Session`` is printed in the COM listener.
#. Observe that you receive the simulated battery status of the kit in the mobile application.
#. Observe that you receive the CGMS records in the mobile application.
   The default time between each record is one minute.
