Overview
********

The LED Button Service (LBS) is a custom service that receives information about the state of an LED and sends notifications when a button changes its state.

You can use the sample to transmit the button state from your development kit to another device.

Building and running
********************

This sample can be found under :file:`samples/bluetooth/ble_lbs/` in the |BMshort| folder structure.

For details on how to create, configure, and program a sample, see :ref:`getting_started_with_the_samples`.

Testing
=======

You can test this sample using `nRF Connect for Desktop`_ with the `Bluetooth Low Energy app`_ and the `Serial Terminal app`_.
Make sure that these are installed before starting the testing procedure.

1. Compile and program the application.
#. In the Serial Terminal, observe that the ``BLE LBS sample started`` message is printed.
#. Observe that the ``Advertising as nRF_BM_LBS`` message is printed.
#. In nRF Connect for Desktop, scan for advertising devices.
   Your device should be advertising as ``nRF_BM_LBS``.
   If the device is not advertising, you might need to use the :guilabel:`Reset Board` option in |VSC|.
#. :guilabel:`Connect` to your device.
   The terminal output in |VSC| indicates ``Peer connected``.
#. In nRF Connect for Desktop, go to :guilabel:`Nordic LED and Button Service` and change :guilabel:`Blinky LED state` to :guilabel:`01`.
   The terminal output in |VSC| indicates ``Received LED ON!``.
#. Change the :guilabel:`Blinky LED state` value back to :guilabel:`00`.
   The terminal output in |VSC| indicates ``Received LED OFF!``.
